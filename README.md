# Adda Coding Assignment

## Problem Statement

We have to build a facilities booking system where we have to check whether those facilities is available or not.

## Setup

* Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/imran120198/Adda_Coding_Assignment.git
   ```

* Run the code

    ```bash
    node adda.js
    ```

* If you want to add input, Go to the bookingRequests and add input

  ```bash

  
  const bookingRequests = [
    ["Clubhouse", "26-10-2020", "16:00", "22:00"],
    ["Tennis Court", "26-10-2020", "16:00", "20:00"],
    ["Clubhouse", "26-10-2020", "16:00", "22:00"],
    ["Tennis Court", "26-10-2020", "17:00", "21:00"],
  ];

  ```
